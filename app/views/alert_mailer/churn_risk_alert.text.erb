==========================================

TUTOR CHURN RISK SCORE (TCRS) - 14 Day Analysis: <%= (@tcrs_score * 100).round(1) %>%
(Higher = More Likely to Leave)

⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY: This tutor is showing disengagement patterns that typically precede voluntary departure.

Why this matters:
Based on 14-day behavior patterns, this tutor shows signs of potential churn - including reduced session counts, irregular scheduling, or declining engagement metrics.

==========================================

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (TIME-SENSITIVE):
  • IMMEDIATE OUTREACH: Schedule a 1-on-1 conversation with <%= @tutor.name %>
  • Understand any challenges, frustrations, or reasons for reduced engagement
  • Discuss their goals and satisfaction with the tutoring role
  • Address any technical, scheduling, or support needs
  • Consider workload adjustments or additional support
  • Follow up weekly to monitor engagement recovery

Impact if not addressed:
Losing a trained tutor disrupts student relationships, increases hiring/training costs, and impacts team morale.
