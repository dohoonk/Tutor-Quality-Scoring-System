⚠️ HIGH RELIABILITY RISK ALERT

Tutor: <%= @tutor.name %> (<%= @tutor.email %>)
Alert Triggered: <%= @alert.triggered_at.strftime('%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p') %>

==========================================

TUTOR HEALTH SCORE (THS) - 7 Day Average: <%= @ths_score %> / 100
(Lower score = More risk)

Why this matters:
This tutor's reliability metrics over the past 7 days have dropped below acceptable thresholds. This includes patterns like lateness, session duration shortfalls, or technical issues.

==========================================

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
  • Review recent session patterns (timing, duration, tech issues)
  • Check in with <%= @tutor.name %> about any personal/technical challenges
  • Provide resources or support to address reliability issues
  • Set clear expectations for session quality standards
  • Monitor for improvement over the next 7 days
